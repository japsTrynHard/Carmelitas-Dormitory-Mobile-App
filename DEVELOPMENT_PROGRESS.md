# CarmeLink Development Progress

Last updated: September 20, 2026

This file tracks development separately from the README. Page ownership is
divided between two developers to reduce merge conflicts.

## Current production-readiness assessment

**Production readiness: approximately 70%.** This is the primary completion
metric for the project. It weights live persistence, authorization, validation,
testing, deployment readiness, and role-complete workflows more heavily than
screens that exist only as UI.

The functional prototype is roughly 89% complete, but that figure is retained
only as a secondary implementation reference and is not the tracked completion
percentage.

Major remaining areas are persisted notifications/preferences, finance/expenses,
discipline, analytics, native tenant device
binding/background location, feedback persistence, real-device geofencing
testing, geofence check-timer testing, and final multi-account security/offline
testing outside the visitor workflow. Android and iOS are both production mobile
targets; a feature is not release-complete until its platform-specific behavior
has either been validated on both or is explicitly tracked as blocked.

## Immediate agenda

1. **Income and expense management** — add owner-only financial records,
   categories, validation, recurring/one-time entries, audit fields, summaries,
   and RLS. This is the next active implementation priority.
2. **Persistent notifications and preferences** — generate role-scoped events,
   read/unread state, deep links, per-user delivery settings, and FCM delivery.
   Implement Android first while keeping the token schema, payloads, routing,
   and Flutter handlers compatible with iOS/APNs from the start.
3. **Disciplinary records** — restricted incident, notice, evidence, and history
   workflow.
4. **Live reports and analytics** — derive owner metrics from the completed
   operational and financial tables.
5. **Native device binding and geofence scheduling** — complete tenant device
   registration, revocation, audit history, and background checks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Account creation and the complete tenant onboarding workflow are deferred,
> not cancelled.** They depend on the group web app and remain a release-critical
> integration. Do not remove their schema, security rules, or documented flow.
> Resume them when the web implementation is available; they are intentionally
> excluded from the immediate agenda above.

The planned contracts module must synchronize through separate contract,
billing-charge, and payment-transaction records. Verified payment amounts and
exact transaction timestamps reduce charge balances; contract changes must not
overwrite historical charges or payment facts. See the full system plan's
**Contract, Billing, and Payment Synchronization** section.

## Workflow improvements

### Geofencing production validation

The boundary evaluator and adaptive interval calculations have automated test
coverage, but this does not prove that scheduled checks execute reliably on a
physical device. Production readiness also requires validating the timer and
operating-system background restrictions across supported platforms.

- [✓] Unit-test polygon/radius boundaries, hysteresis, permissions, failures, and adaptive interval calculations.
- [✓] Implement the actual recurring geofence check scheduler; interval recommendations alone are not a running timer.
- [ ] Test timer rescheduling at daytime, pre-curfew, active-curfew, and curfew-sleep transitions.
- [✓] Verify that only one timer is active and that logout, account changes, and disposal cancel it.
- [ ] Test foreground, background, app-resume, device-restart, and operating-system power-management behavior on physical Android and iOS devices.
- [ ] Test denied permission, permanently denied permission, disabled GPS, timeouts, poor signal, and restored-location recovery.
- [✓] Confirm duplicate checks do not create duplicate IN/OUT events and that retry/backoff behavior is bounded.
- [ ] Run an on-site inside/outside boundary walk test and compare recorded transitions with the configured dormitory polygon.

### Mobile-store approval and cross-platform release risk

Both **Google Play** and the **Apple App Store** are release targets. Current
planning estimates are risk indicators rather than guarantees: approximately
75% first-submission approval likelihood for Google Play and 55% for the Apple
App Store in the current state. After the release-readiness checklist below is
completed, the working estimates rise to about 90% and 80–85%, respectively.

The largest shared review risk is background location/geofencing. Google Play
requires background location to be demonstrably central to the app and may
require a declaration and review video. Apple also requires a clear purpose,
appropriate permission timing, accurate privacy disclosures, and reliable
on-device behavior. FCM itself is not a material approval risk when permission,
privacy, and notification behavior are implemented correctly.

- [ ] Publish an accurate privacy policy and complete Google Data Safety and Apple App Privacy disclosures.
- [ ] Provide in-app account deletion and the required web deletion-request route when in-app account creation is enabled.
- [ ] Prepare stable reviewer accounts/instructions for owner, caretaker, tenant, and guardian roles.
- [ ] Provide a reviewer-safe method or instructions for evaluating geofence behavior away from the dormitory.
- [ ] Document and justify background-location use; request only the minimum permission scope on each platform.
- [ ] Validate notifications, location, camera, photo access, deep links, sign-out, and account switching on physical Android and iOS devices.
- [ ] Remove mock data, test credentials, placeholders, broken actions, visible overflow, and incomplete metadata before submission.
- [ ] Produce signed Android App Bundle and iOS archive/TestFlight builds from the same release candidate.
- [ ] Complete any applicable Google Play closed-testing requirement before applying for production access.

### Account creation → contract — IMPORTANT, DEFERRED

After an authorized owner or caretaker creates a **tenant** account, no
verification message is sent automatically. When the tenant attempts to sign
in, CarmeLink holds the account on a verification page. The tenant selects
**Send code** to request a six-digit email OTP; SMS verification remains on
hold. The account-creation success screen should then offer **Create contract
now** and **Do this later**.
All new account roles require email and mobile verification, while only tenant
accounts continue into contract onboarding.
Choosing the first action opens the live contract editor with the new tenant ID
prefilled and locked for the initial contract. Guardian, caretaker, and owner
accounts skip this step.

Account and contract creation remain separate transactions. A valid account is
not rolled back when contract entry is deferred or fails; the tenant remains
visible in the directory and the incomplete onboarding state can be resumed.
The contract may be saved as Draft while account verification is pending. The
workflow then generates a versioned printable PDF, records that signatures are
awaited, accepts a private upload of the scanned signed paper, and requires
owner verification before activation. Contract activation currently requires
verified email and a verified signed document. Mobile verification remains on
hold until an SMS provider is selected. Afterward, the guided workflow
continues to room/bed assignment and guardian linking.

Canonical end-to-end tenant onboarding order:

1. Create the tenant authentication account and protected profile.
2. Verify email and mobile number, then set a permanent password.
3. Offer **Create contract now** or **Do this later**.
4. Create a tenant-locked **Draft** contract with its financial terms, term,
   and recurring due day (the contract start day).
5. Generate the immutable PDF, collect signatures, and upload the signed copy.
6. Owner verifies the signed document; the contract remains Draft.
7. Owner activates the contract after the verification checklist passes.
8. Activation generates deposit and first-rent charges; future charges remain
   Upcoming until their due dates.
9. Tenant submits the required initial payment and staff verifies it. Only
   verified transaction amounts reduce the charge balance.
10. Assign the tenant's room and bed.
11. Create or confirm the guardian link when required.
12. Bind the tenant's trusted device and configure required device permissions.
13. Mark onboarding complete and unlock the permitted tenant workflows.

Contract lifecycle and document lifecycle remain separate: `draft -> active ->
expired/terminated` versus `not_generated -> awaiting_signature ->
pending_verification -> verified/rejected`. Device binding is tenant-only and
must not block staff-side account or Draft-contract preparation.

Implementation follow-up:

- [✓] Return the created tenant profile ID from the account-management flow.
- [✓] Create accounts without automatic email, then send and verify a
  six-digit email OTP only when the user selects **Send code**; SMS OTP is on
  hold pending provider selection.
- [✓] Expose Pending/Verified email state and independent On hold mobile state.
- [✓] Add `Create contract now` and `Do this later` success actions for owners.
- [✓] Open the contract editor with the tenant preselected and locked.
- [✓] Generate an immutable, versioned printable contract PDF.
- [✓] Upload the signed paper privately and record uploader/time/file metadata.
- [✓] Add owner signed-document verification before contract activation.
- [✓] Display an onboarding-incomplete indicator for tenants without contracts.
- [✓] Continue from signed-document verification to room/bed assignment and guardian linking.
- [ ] Replace free contract-status selection with a prerequisite-aware owner
  **Activate contract** action.
- [ ] Add initial-payment, room/bed, guardian, permanent-password,
  device-binding, and permission requirements to one resumable checklist.
- [ ] Prevent required room/bed assignment until configured initial charges are
  fully paid, while keeping guardian linking independently resumable.

## Status legend

- [✓] Completed and connected, or fully complete as a static feature
- [ ] Incomplete, including UI that still uses mock data
- **Live** — connected to Supabase
- **Mock** — uses local demonstration data or a simulated workflow

## Important core of the system

These modules should be completed before optional automation such as OCR,
geofencing or advanced analytics.

1. **Identity and access** — authentication, profiles, roles, verification, and RLS.
2. **People and relationships** — tenants, guardians, staff, and their verified links.
3. **Rooms and occupancy** — rooms, beds, assignments, vacancies, and contracts.
4. **Payments** — charges, balances, receipts, verification, and payment history.
5. **Maintenance** — submissions, locations, assignments, status, and resolution.
6. **Presence, curfew, and visitors** — auditable events and approval workflows.
7. **Communication** — announcements, notifications, and role-scoped messaging.
8. **Safety and privacy** — confidential reports, audit logs, retention, and permissions.

## Completed Milestones History

> **Sep 20, 2026 — Contract-to-Billing Synchronization:** Added separate
> immutable billing-charge and payment-transaction ledgers. Activating a
> contract idempotently generates its deposit and monthly rent schedule with
> frozen term snapshots. Only verified transactions reduce server-calculated
> balances; partial payments remain supported, and historical financial facts
> cannot be rewritten by later contract or review changes. Existing invoices
> and payment submissions are preserved through a ledger migration.

> **Sep 19, 2026 — Message Read Receipts:** Added server-timestamped `read_at`
> receipts, recipient-only read updates through a protected RPC, automatic read
> marking when a conversation is viewed, realtime receipt updates, and Sent/Read
> indicators for owner, caretaker, tenant, and guardian message views. Migration
> `202609190013` is deployed. Multi-account production testing remains.

> **Sep 19, 2026 — Signed Contract Document Workflow:** Added owner-side
> generation and sharing of versioned contract PDFs, immutable private storage
> for generated and signed copies, SHA-256 file metadata, signed-copy review,
> and activation guards requiring both verified tenant email and an
> owner-verified signed document. Migration `202609190010` is deployed. The
> complete Flutter suite passes at 186/186 tests, static analysis reports no
> issues, and the Android debug APK builds successfully.

> **Sep 19, 2026 — Contract Production Verification:** Added and ran a remote
> multi-role smoke test against the deployed Supabase project. It verifies
> owner create/read/update/delete, tenant/guardian/caretaker isolation across
> read/write/delete operations, invalid-date rejection, tenant-only contract
> association, and cleanup of the temporary record. The complete Flutter suite
> passes at 183/183 tests and static analysis reports no issues.

> **Sep 19, 2026 — Live Contract CRUD:** Added an owner-only Supabase contract
> register with create, read, update, and delete operations; tenant association,
> contract number, term, rent, deposit, lifecycle status, notes, search, and
> filters. Database constraints enforce valid dates, non-negative amounts,
> unique contract numbers, and one active contract per tenant. Migration
> `202609190007` and date-summary sync migration `202609190008` are deployed.
> Contract-to-billing synchronization was completed on Sep 20, 2026; contract
> edits never rewrite generated charges or payment history.

> **Sep 19, 2026 — Visitor Production Verification:** Added and ran a remote
> multi-account smoke test across tenant, guardian, owner, and caretaker
> identities. It verifies tenant submission and visibility, guardian isolation,
> blocked tenant approval, owner approval, caretaker arrival/departure, final
> completion, and three append-only audit events under deployed RLS policies.

> **Sep 19, 2026 — Production Data & Responsive Hardening:** Removed runtime
> `MockData` fallbacks from operational controllers, payment services,
> messaging, and shared notification views. Backend failures now remain visible
> instead of fabricating successful records. Added a 30-case responsive matrix
> spanning representative tenant, guardian, caretaker, and owner pages across
> narrow phone, landscape, tablet, desktop, and enlarged text; all cases pass.

> **Sep 19, 2026 — Visitor Workflow Database Hardening (Phase 1):** Added a
> controlled visitor lifecycle (`pending` → `approved`/`rejected`/`cancelled`
> → `arrived` → `completed`), protected staff/tenant transition RPC, reviewer
> metadata, append-only arrival/departure events, role-scoped RLS, audit-safe
> cancellation, indexes, and real-time publication. Visitor language now uses
> arrival, departure, and presence rather than implying gate staff or hardware.

> **Sep 19, 2026 — Live Visitor Workflow (Phase 2):** Replaced visitor mock
> data with Supabase-backed tenant and staff controllers, request submission,
> cancellation, approval/rejection, arrival/departure recording, role-visible
> history, loading/error states, and real-time refresh. Added visitor model and
> controller coverage; 150/150 tests pass.

> **Sep 19, 2026 — Visitor Scheduling & Contact Rules:** Added pending-request
> editing, visitor contact numbers, arrival/departure pickers, and an explicit
> no-overnight policy. PostgreSQL validates that departure follows arrival on
> the same Asia/Manila calendar date, while the app provides immediate matching
> validation and clearly communicates the dormitory rule.

> **Sep 19, 2026 — Owner Confidential Report Review:** Connected the owner-only
> confidential report register to Supabase with mandatory private decision
> notes, status workflow, protected RPCs, and an append-only audit trail for
> register access and status changes. Caretakers and guardians remain blocked.

> **Sep 19, 2026 — Tenant-only Device Binding:** Removed Device Binding from
> guardian, caretaker, and owner Settings views and added a tenant-only role
> guard to the page. Other roles cannot expose it through direct navigation.

> **Sep 19, 2026 — Owner-only Geofence Diagnostics:** Removed the Geofence Dev
> Dashboard from shared Settings and added a direct owner role guard. Shared
> Settings now contains only user-relevant privacy and permission controls.

> **Sep 19, 2026 — Feedback UI:** Added a shared Settings feedback screen for
> all roles with a 1–5 star rating, feedback categories, detailed comments,
> optional account context, validation, and an explicit UI-only disclosure.
> Backend persistence and staff review are intentionally deferred.

> **Sep 19, 2026 — Tenant Confidential Reports (Phase 1):** Tenants can submit
> validated confidential safety, rule, roommate, or other concerns and view
> only their own immutable submission history. Supabase RLS denies access to
> unrelated accounts. Owner/caretaker review is intentionally deferred until
> the next approved role phase.

> **Sep 19, 2026 — Secure Cloudinary Media Integration:** Maintenance evidence
> and payment receipts now use server-side authenticated Cloudinary uploads.
> Secrets remain in Supabase Edge Functions, database RLS authorizes each view,
> links expire after five minutes, uploads are optimized, and legacy Supabase
> Storage paths remain readable.

### Media Pipeline & Upgrades

**Implemented Sep 19, 2026:** Secure Cloudinary media storage is connected for
maintenance evidence and payment receipts. Assets use Cloudinary's
`authenticated` delivery type. Upload, URL, and delete operations run through
JWT-protected Supabase Edge Functions; existing database RLS authorizes every
view before a five-minute private-download URL is returned. JPG, PNG, and WEBP
uploads retain the 5 MB limit and receive incoming optimization plus eager
1200px and 320px derivatives. Legacy Supabase Storage paths remain supported.
User avatars are not yet part of the current upload workflow.

- [✓] **Cloudinary Media Storage & CDN Integration** *(implemented for maintenance evidence and payment receipts)*:
  - **Authenticated storage**: Maintenance evidence and payment receipts are private Cloudinary assets; avatars are not yet part of the upload workflow.
  - **Optimization**: Incoming images are limited to 2400px with automatic quality selection; 1200px and 320px eager derivatives are prepared.
  - **Protected delivery**: RLS-authorized Edge Functions return expiring private-download URLs instead of public asset URLs.
  - **Egress savings**: New binary uploads no longer consume Supabase Storage capacity or object-delivery bandwidth.
  - **Backward compatibility**: Existing private Supabase Storage paths remain readable while new rows store opaque Cloudinary references.

## Development handoff

Tenant and Guardian development can continue without waiting for the Owner or
Caretaker interfaces. The authentication, profile, relationship, room, bed,
assignment, and initial RLS foundations are already available.

### Developer 2 functions that are truly independent

These functions do not require a completed Owner/Caretaker page or an
owner-created operational record. Their database tables and RLS policies still
need to be agreed on before implementation.

#### Tenant

- [✓] Sign in, sign out, view authenticated profile, and change password.
- [✓] Use local theme/settings and view Rules and Dormitory Information.
- [ ] Edit only the tenant's permitted personal and emergency-contact fields.
- [ ] Create and view the tenant's own maintenance submissions in `Pending` state.
- [ ] Create, view, and cancel the tenant's own unreviewed visitor requests.
- [ ] Create, view, and cancel the tenant's own unreviewed curfew requests.
- [✓] Submit and view the tenant's own confidential concerns.
- [ ] Persist the tenant's own notification preferences.

#### Guardian

- [✓] Sign in, sign out, view authenticated profile, and change password.
- [✓] View the existing verified guardian-to-tenant relationship.
- [✓] Use local theme/settings and view Dormitory Information.
- [ ] Edit only the guardian's permitted personal contact fields.
- [✓] View curfew requests submitted by an already-linked tenant.
- [✓] Approve or reject those requests with remarks and a decision timestamp.
- [ ] Persist the guardian's own notification preferences.

The curfew workflow above depends on the Tenant and Guardian implementations,
but it does not require the Owner page. The request may remain
`Awaiting staff decision` after the guardian response.

### Functions that depend on Owner, Caretaker, or external system data

- [ ] Room, bed, roommate, occupancy, and contract display needs staff assignment data.
- [ ] Payment balances and history need owner-created charges and payment records.
- [ ] Payment verification needs an owner/caretaker decision.
- [ ] Maintenance assignment, progress, and completion need caretaker actions.
- [ ] Announcements and emergency alerts need staff-published content.
- [ ] Staff messaging needs a staff participant and response workflow.
- [ ] Gate activity needs verified geofence or manual staff records.
- [ ] Visitor requests need staff approval for a completed workflow.
- [✓] Curfew requests need a final staff decision for a completed workflow.
- [ ] Geofencing, OCR, and analytics need external services.

### Recommended independent implementation order

1. Permitted self-profile editing.
2. Tenant maintenance submission and own-history viewing.
3. Tenant curfew submission and Guardian approval/rejection.
4. Tenant visitor submission and cancellation.
5. Tenant confidential-concern submission.
6. Tenant and Guardian notification preferences.

### Shared contracts that must be agreed first

- [ ] Table and column names for payments, maintenance, announcements, curfew,
  visitors, messages, and notifications.
- [ ] Allowed status values and valid status transitions.
- [ ] Model and repository method names used by Flutter.
- [ ] Tenant ownership and guardian-link rules used by RLS.
- [ ] Storage bucket names and upload rules.
- [ ] Real-time subscription channels where required.

### File ownership during the handoff

- `lib/views/caretaker/`
- `lib/views/auth/`
- `lib/services/account_service.dart`
- `lib/views/shared/account_management_page.dart`

- `lib/views/guardian/`
- `lib/controllers/tenant_controller.dart`
- `lib/controllers/guardian_controller.dart`
- New tenant/guardian repositories and services agreed by both developers.

Shared files require coordination before editing:

- `lib/models/models.dart`

- `lib/core/`
- `pubspec.yaml`

### Handoff rules

- [ ] Developer 2 works from a dedicated `feature/tenant-guardian-live-data` branch.
- [ ] Do not edit migrations `001` through `006`; create a new migration instead.
- [ ] Never place the Supabase service-role key in Flutter code or assets.
- [ ] Keep all role restrictions in RLS or protected server functions.
- [ ] Test changes using both tenant and guardian accounts.
- [ ] Confirm that each role is denied access to unrelated records.
- [ ] Update this progress file in the same pull request as each completed feature.

### Planned account verification flow

1. Authorized staff creates the account.
2. The user receives a secure email invitation.
3. The invitation opens onboarding and the user creates a permanent password.
4. SMS verification is requested according to the account role or sensitive action.
5. Required verification must succeed before protected access is granted.

| Role | SMS requirement |
|---|---|
| Owner | Required during onboarding |
| Caretaker | Required during onboarding |
| Guardian | Required before approving sensitive requests |
| Tenant | Required before gate, visitor, and account-recovery actions |

The email invitation verifies ownership of the email address. The SMS code
separately verifies the registered phone and is never placed inside the email
link.
